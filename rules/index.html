                        <li class="astro-2BHXZWTG">Your character must have traits, motives, beliefs, etc. they abide to. They do not have to be the strictest; however, ignoring them consistently is against the rule.</li>
                        <li class="astro-2BHXZWTG">Characters should have real lives. They should eat, sleep, work, socialize, and have real motivations. Characters built solely around getting the chance to PvP and kill other player characters, colloquially known as "Joe Assassins", are not allowed.</li>
                        <li class="astro-2BHXZWTG">When a player dies at the hands of another player in-game, and the killer states that they would like it to be canon, the victim can choose between either canonically dying or taking a grave injury.</li>

The grave injury MUST affect the player's RP in some way; this can add a physical disability, affect their mental capacities, or both. Try to make it fun and interesting!</li>
                        <li class="astro-2BHXZWTG">The exception to rule 5 is if there is beyond a doubt no way that the victim could survive the attack. This includes but is not limited to direct explosions, lava submersion (not them touching lava/fire and running away), and falling from extreme heights. If you are unsure if this exception applies, or the two players have a disagreement, then form a ticket and allow staff to decide.</li>
                        <li class="astro-2BHXZWTG">While not all character deaths can be planned easily, your character must have a valid reason to kill a player for a canon death / grave injury to apply. As a rule of thumb, it is always best to contact staff first via ticket. If a staff member is your target, instead of making a ticket, contact a different staff member by DM and be sure that they make note of it."</li>
